The token_required decorator function uses the jwt.decode method to verify the token's signature and extract its payload, ensuring it was issued by this application and hasn't been tampered with. This method provides a secure way of knowing if a request comes from an authenticated user.\n",

    "Token-based access control: The token_required decorator is used to protect routes that should only be accessible to authenticated users.

    "### Explanation of Code Parts In detail\n",
    "\n",
    "#### token_required decorator function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The token_required decorator function is designed to ensure that the user is authenticated before they can access certain routes. Here's what each part does:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decorator function @wraps(f) preserves information about the decorated function f that might be needed later for introspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "token = None initializes a token variable as None before trying to extract the token from the cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then attempts to extract the token value from the Cookie header in the incoming HTTP request. It first loads the Cookie string into a SimpleCookie object, then checks if a token key exists, if so, it sets the token variable to the token's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no token value could be found, the function returns a JSON response indicating that a valid token is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then tries to decode the token using the SECRET_KEY set in the application configuration. If the token is invalid (it can't be decoded, or its signature doesn't match), it returns a JSON response indicating that the token is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the token is successfully decoded, the data variable contains the payload of the token, and current_user is set to the user object that corresponds to the username in the payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decorator finally returns the decorated function f, and passes along the current_user and any additional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### /register route:\n",
    "\n",
    "This route allows new users to register. Here's what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "It first retrieves the JSON data from the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "It checks if the username and password fields are present in the request data. If not, it returns a 400 response indicating that the fields are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then checks if a user with the provided username already exists in the database. If such a user exists, it returns a 400 response indicating that the user already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the username is not taken, it hashes the provided password using bcrypt, and creates a new User object with the provided username and hashed password.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then adds the new user to the database and commits the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it returns a 201 response indicating that the new user was successfully created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### /login route:\n",
    "\n",
    "This route allows existing users to log in. Here's what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "It first retrieves the username and password from the JSON data in the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then tries to retrieve the User object that corresponds to the provided username from the database. If no such user exists, or if the provided password doesn't match the stored password for the user, it returns a 400 response indicating that the login credentials are invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user is authenticated, it creates a JWT token for them. The token's payload contains the user's username, and it's encoded using the SECRET_KEY set in the application configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then creates a response indicating that the login was successful, and sets a cookie in the response with the name token and the value of the JWT token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it returns the response to the client.\n",
