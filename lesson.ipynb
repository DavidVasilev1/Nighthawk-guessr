    "## Time and Space Complexity of Algorithms (Ethan Z, Alex)\n",
    "The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand.\n",

    "The quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a `partition()` procedure that **pivots** and *sorts* (not really) our list, and a `qSortUserList()` that performs recursion and actually finishes the sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Logic\n",
    "The partition procedure will serve to \"partition\" our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don't have to sorted yet!). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partition procedure\n",
    "First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a pivot. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsort list. The procedure also defines a `pivot_pos` variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that's one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "pivot = arr[hi][1]\n",
    "pivot_pos = lo - 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "for idx in range(lo, hi):\n",
    "    if arr[idx][1] >= pivot:\n",
    "        pivot_pos+=1\n",
    "        arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the `pivot_pos+1` index with our pivot element at the `hi` index to place the pivot at it's rightful place. We know that `pivot_pos+1` must be smaller than `hi` because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1]\n",
    "return pivot_pos+1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### qSort procedure\n",
    "If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It's hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the `partition` procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity analysis\n",
    "To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, we have a total of log_2(n) function calls, where n is the length of the input array. However, within each fucntion call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to a value m, the length of the partition array. Because the length of each partition is also proportional to the length of the input array, we can also conclude the m is proportional to n, and we can also generalize log_2(n) as simply log(n). Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as **O(nlogn)**, where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don't create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to O(logn), we can conclude that quickSort has an **O(1)** space complexity for an iterative method, and an **O(logn)** space complexity for a recursive method."
