#### Read

![]({{site.baseurl}}/lessonimages/read.png " ")

Parser is used in order to look through dataset for all values and send them to frontend.

#### Update

![]({{site.baseurl}}/lessonimages/update.png " ")

Parser is used to look for specific data value you are searching for and then update another specific value based on that found data fragment.

#### Delete

![]({{site.baseurl}}/lessonimages/delete.png " ")
